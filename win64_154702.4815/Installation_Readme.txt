VII.   INSTALLATION SWITCHES

The switches in the Setup.exe file will have the following syntax. 
Switches are not case-sensitive and may be specified in any order 
(except for the -s switch). Switches must be separated by spaces.
SETUP [-b] [-overwrite] [-nowinsat] [-l<LCID>] [-s] [-report <path>] 

GFX-INSTALLATION CUSTOM SWITCHES
-b Forces a system reboot after the installation completes.
In non-silent mode, the absence of this switch will prompt
the user to reboot. In silent mode, the absence of this
switch forces the Setup.exe to complete without rebooting
(the user must manually reboot to conclude the installation
process).

-overwrite Installs the Intel(R) Graphics Driver regardless of 
the version of previously installed driver. In non-silent mode,
the absence of this switch will prompt the user to confirm
overwrite of a newer Intel(R) Graphics Driver. In silent mode, 
the absence of this switch means that the installation will 
abort any attempts to regress the revision of the Intel(R) Graphics 
driver.

-l<LCID> Specifies the language used in the installation user 
interface. Without this switch, the installation user interface 
will be shown in the Display language of the OS by default. 
Hexadecimal values for the supported languages can be found in 
the localized language abbreviations section of this readme.

-s Runs in silent mode. The absence of this switch causes
the installation to be performed in verbose mode.

-report <path> Specifies an alternate location for the log file 
created by a silent installation. By default, the log file is 
created and stored during a silent installation under <root 
directory>\Intel\Logs directory as IntelGFX.log
(<WINDIR>\Temp\IntelGFX.log).

-nowinsat Turns off the automatic support for updating / 
obtaining the WinSAT* DWM score on Windows* during installation. 
In non-silent mode, the absence of this switch will enable 
automatic support for updating the WinSAT* score, but allows 
the option to disable this support with a user accessible 
checkbox shown within the installation user interface. 
In silent mode, the absence of this switch forces an automatic 
run of WinSAT and will enable the Windows* Aero* desktop theme 
(if supported).
